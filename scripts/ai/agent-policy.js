/**
 * Application-owned action policy for QA Agent results.
 *
 * "LLM proposes. Application policy decides. Application executes." The
 * model's classification/shouldCreateBug are a recommendation, never an
 * authoritative action decision - this module is the one place that
 * decides whether a "create a product bug" recommendation is actually
 * allowed to survive into the final report. Only PRODUCT_BUG may keep a
 * true shouldCreateBug; every other classification is forced to false,
 * regardless of what the model suggested. PRODUCT_BUG itself is left
 * exactly as the model said - true stays true, false stays false - this
 * is a ceiling on which classifications MAY create a bug, not a floor
 * that turns every PRODUCT_BUG into an automatic bug filing (a future,
 * separate confidence-threshold policy, not this one).
 *
 * Called with an already-validated (TSB-F04 closed result contract) result - this is
 * not a second validator, so it never re-checks confidence/evidence/
 * rootCause/recommendedFix/etc. It only reasons about the two fields its
 * own decision depends on.
