/**
 * Browser input aggregator for the centralized QA AI triage job.
 *
 * Each Cypress browser job (cypress-tests' chrome/edge matrix legs, plus
 * the standalone firefox-tests job since Roadmap #14C) uploads its own
 * small, browser-scoped artifact (browser-result.json always; context.json/
 * history.json only when that leg actually failed - see
 * .github/workflows/cypress.yml). This script runs downstream, after every
 * browser job has finished, once their artifacts have been downloaded into
 * reports/ai/browser-inputs/<browser>/:
 *
 *   read every browser's result -> decide whether ANY of them failed ->
 *   if so, deterministically pick ONE primary failing browser -> copy
 *   its context.json/history.json into the exact paths analyze-failure.js
 *   already reads (reports/ai/context.json, reports/ai/history.json).
 *
 * This is intentionally a "pick one, don't merge" strategy, not a
 * multi-browser reasoning layer: analyze-failure.js, qa-agent-prompt.js,
 * and the provider contract are completely unaware this file exists and
 * need zero changes - they still see exactly the single-context.json
 * shape they always have. The result is that "AI provider.analyze()" is
 * called at most once per workflow run by construction, since there is
 * now exactly one place (this script, feeding the unmodified
 * analyze-failure.js) where that can happen at all - not because of any
 * new locking/dedup logic.
 *
 * Other browsers that also failed are not silently dropped - they're
 * logged (this script's own stdout) so a human reading CI logs can see
 * "chrome was analyzed, edge also failed" - and, since PR #33, also
 * summarized as deterministic "browserCorrelation" metadata (which
 * browsers ran, which failed/passed, single- vs multi-browser scope, and
 * whether failed browsers share the same evidence signature) attached to
 * the primary browser's context.json before analyze-failure.js ever runs.
 * This is still a "pick one context, don't merge results" strategy, not a
 * multi-browser reasoning layer of its own: the correlation object is
 * computed here, deterministically, from Cypress's own recorded outcomes -
 * never by an LLM - and is handed to the model as evidence alongside the
 * primary failure, not as a second analysis target. "AI provider.analyze()"
 * is still called at most once per workflow run, by the same construction
 * as before (this script feeds one context object to the unmodified
 * analyze-failure.js).

// as the default priority order used to deterministically pick a primary
// browser when more than one failed, so the same input always yields the
// same choice. This is also the list readBrowserInputs() below actually
// looks for artifact directories under when main() calls it with no

// Roadmap #21G: "playwright-chromium" is deliberately last - Cypress

// still selected as primary, exactly as adding firefox last did not
// change chrome/edge's own relative priority. Playwright's failure is
// never silently dropped when it isn't primary - it is always represented

// buildBrowserCorrelation()), the same "pick one, don't merge" contract
// that already applies to any two Cypress browsers both failing. This
