/**
 * Flaky-test history collector.
 *
 * Queries the GitHub Actions REST API for the last N completed runs of
 * this workflow on a reference branch (default: main), and aggregates how
 * often THIS matrix leg's job (browser) passed/failed - a cheap,
 * GitHub-native signal: no external database, no artifact downloads/unzip,
 * no new npm dependency (uses Node's built-in fetch).
 *
 * Job-level (i.e. per-browser), not per-individual-test: this repo's
 * structured test reports are only uploaded on failure (see
 * cypress-report-<browser> in the workflow), so there is nothing to parse
 * for *passing* historical runs - job conclusion is the cheapest signal
 * that is actually available for every run, pass or fail.
 *
 * Reference branch is always `main`, not the current branch: for a
 * pull_request run this deliberately looks at trunk's recent trend for
 * this browser (a stable signal), not the PR's own short-lived branch
 * (which usually has no history at all on its first run).
 *
 * Entirely optional and best-effort: no token, an API error, this being
 * the first-ever run, or anything else going wrong writes an
 * { available: false } marker and exits 0 - analyze-failure.js treats
 * history as optional input and keeps working without it.
